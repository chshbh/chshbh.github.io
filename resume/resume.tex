\runsubsection{YATE, Yet Another Text Editor}
\descript{| Aug 2016 - Nov 2016  }
\location{To create a lightweight text editor using C and Python language.}
\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}
\item Created a primitive text editor using curses library.
\item Security Algorithms: Base64 Encoding, AES Encryption, SHA256 Hashing, and String Obfuscation.
\item Each file would be replicated with algorithms separately, generating four unique files.
\end{tightemize}

\runsubsection{A Graph Header File}
\descript{| Febâ€™17 - Ongoing  }
\location{To create a Graph library (a partial implementation of CS 97SI).}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Graph library for C++ and python
\item supports both Adjacency Matrix and List to store graph
\item supports Graph Traversal using DFS \& BFS
\item does Topological Sort
\item checks for Eulerian Circuit
\item finds Minimum Spanning Tree using Kruskal's \& Prim's
\item checks for Strongly Connected Components (SCC) using Kosaraju's
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\runsubsection{ Password Manager}
\descript{| Ongoing  }
\location{To create a personal password manager.}
\begin{tightemize}
\item SqlCipher Database is used to encrypt the database file with AES.
\item peewee ORM is used to map and interact with the database.
\item Create, store, edit and generate password, that allows user to use a single "master" password to
generate unique passwords for all the sites and services.
\item Generated unique password using SHA.
